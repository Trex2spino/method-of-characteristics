Code Structure Ideation: 

	Main Modules: 
		
		TMC flow solver - solves flow field around cone
		IDL generator - generates idl from tmc solution 
		MOC mesh generator - propogates solution from idl 
		flow analysis - looks at mesh and calculates mass flow, pressure, temp, etc.
		Plotting/Postprocessing - takes finished mesh, geometry, tmc solution and plots results
		
		
	meshpoint = instance of mesh class 
	Store meshpoints in 'generations' with first generation being idl
		generations = [[pt1, pt2, pt3, ...], [pt1, pt2, pt3]] huge list!!!
