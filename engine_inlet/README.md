# Air-Inlet-Method-of-Characteristics-Analysis-Tool (AIMCAT)

This python-based tool contains modules used to model axisymmetric and two-dimensional supersonic air inlets. The primary method used 
is the method of characteristics which models most of the supersonic flow.

# Requirements

The following packages are required: 
numpy, scipy, matplotlib, json

# How to use

The intended workflow for this tool is as follows: 
1. configure input files (launch file, geometry file, and plot profile)
2. run the main.py file by calling python main.py 
3. generate a mesh, save a solution, export, make a plot, etc.
